# LawScope
Platform for sharing ideas utilizing simple code and custom language scripts

## Version 1 Alpha
### LawScope.XML
The XML file can be imported into any text editor worth a damn. I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
The XML file contains the user-defined language rules for syntax highlighting. This feature will change drastically during development. Currently, Github is highlighting wrong keywords so I may have to create a new extention type.

### LawScope.ls
This is really a text file but will later have features and syntax that an interpretor can handle. This is a very loose example of an law that can be shared. The result of this file will be fed into a web-based app or custom UI.
